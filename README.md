# 📊 Business Data Analytics Portfolio

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository hosts my portfolio projects from the **Business Data Analytics Masterclass** at Brit College of Engineering & Technology. The goal of these projects was to transform raw business data into interactive, visual narratives that drive strategic decision-making.

I utilized **Microsoft Power BI** for financial performance analysis and **Tableau** for global supply chain and logistics tracking.
